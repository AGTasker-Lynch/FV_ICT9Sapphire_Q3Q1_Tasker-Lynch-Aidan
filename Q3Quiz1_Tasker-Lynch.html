                <h2>Fight Club </h2>
                <p> Cast: Brad Pitt, Edward Norton. Helena Bonham Carter. Director: David Fincher
                <p>A depressed man meets a strange soap salesman in a plane trip named Tyler Durden and we then see him living in Tyler's wrecked and old house after his apartment got destroyed by a explosive. The two men who were bored decided to form an underground fighting group for the men who are tired of their boring and repetitive lives and want to feel fulfilled again.</p>
                <p> Rating: IMDb: 8.8/10, "Fight Club did indeed fly over the heads of audiences expecting straight macho action thrills, as opposed to a mind-messing critique of the same, as well as capitalism, material acquisition, masculinity and other sacred cows of national identity."- Dennis Harvey Rotten Tomatoes

                <h2>Taxi Driver</h2>
                <p> Cast: Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel. Director: Martin Scorsese
                <p>A lone veteran named Travis Bickle decides to be a cab driver and the more he's out at night the more he wishes to clean up the filthy city he lives in. After meeting a campaign worker he gets the idea of saving the city but first plots to assassinate a presidential candidate but decided to save a 12 year old prostitute from evil gangsters</p>
                <p> Ratings: IMDb: 8.2/10, ""Taxi Driver" shouldn't be taken as a New York film; it's not about a city but about the weathers of a man's soul, and out of all New York he selects just those elements that feed and reinforce his obsessions. The man is Travis Bickle, ex-Marine, veteran of Vietnam, composer of dutiful anniversary notes to his parents, taxi driver, killer. The movie rarely strays very far from the personal, highly subjective way in which he sees the city and lets it wound him."- Roger Ebert

                <h2>No Country For Old Men</h2>
                <p> Cast: Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones Director: The Coen Brothers
                <p>In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart</p>
